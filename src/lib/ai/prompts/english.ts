  format: `**Output Format Requirements:**

### 1. **Pure JSON Only**
- Return ONLY valid JSON without any introduction, explanation, or code blocks (\`\`\`)
- Perfect JSON syntax compliance (commas, quotes, brackets)
- Key names must be 100% identical to examples (no translation)

### 2. **Real Location Structure**
Configure route.steps based on the **actual visiting order and spatial layout** of each tourist destination or location.

**🎯 Title Format: "Specific Location Name - Its Feature/Significance"**

**✅ Various Title Examples:**
- "Great Hall - Where History Comes Alive"
- "Bell Tower - Guardian of Sacred Time"  
- "Observatory Deck - City Views Beyond Imagination"
- "Central Courtyard - Heart of Ancient Wisdom"

### 3. **Perfect Connection of 3 Fields 🚨 Core Enhancement**

**✅ Correct Structure:**
\`\`\`
sceneDescription: Background + Observation → Natural curiosity question
coreNarrative: Answer to curiosity + Historical context → Character story preview  
humanStories: Actual character stories → Emotional conclusion
nextDirection: (Separate) Movement guidance only
\`\`\`

**🚨 Natural Flow Connectivity - Very Important!**
- Use unique and natural connectors appropriate for each location
- Avoid predictable templates, use varied expressions suitable for situations
- Sound like a real guide speaking spontaneously and naturally

**❌ Avoid Template-like Expressions:**
- "Have you ever wondered what secrets this place holds?"
- "Let me tell you the fascinating story behind this..."
- "You know, there's an amazing tale about the people here"

**✅ Recommended Natural Expressions:**
- "What's particularly interesting here is..."
- "You might be curious to know that..."
- "Here's something that might surprise you..."
- "If you look closely, you'll notice..."`,

  qualityStandards: `**Quality Standards (Most Important!):**
- **More content is better. Never skimp on details.** Include minor architectural details, hidden symbols, historical background, interesting anecdotes about related people, behind-the-scenes stories - comprehensive information.
- **Friendly and conversational tone:** Not rigid explanations, but a style like a friend or the best guide passionately explaining beside you.
- **Perfect storytelling:** Connect all information like one giant story.

**📍 Essential Chapter Composition Requirements:**
- **Generate at least 5-7 chapters**: Set up separate chapters for each main observation point
- **Organize by visit route order**: Efficient single-stroke route from entrance to exit
- **🚨 CRITICAL: Mandatory synchronization between route.steps and realTimeGuide.chapters 🚨**
  * The number of elements in route.steps array and realTimeGuide.chapters array **must match exactly**
  * The title of each step and corresponding chapter title **must be completely identical**
  * The order of steps and chapters **must match exactly**
  * Violating this rule will cause system errors!
- **Minimum writing standards per field**:
  * sceneDescription: Over 200 characters, vivid description stimulating all 5 senses
  * coreNarrative: Over 300 characters, detailed explanation of historical facts and significance
  * humanStories: Over 200 characters, specific anecdotes of people and episodes
  * nextDirection: Over 100 characters, clear route guidance and distance
- **Absolutely prohibited empty content**: All fields must be filled with real content`

The intricate stone carvings above tell stories of saints and sinners, while the worn steps beneath your feet have been polished smooth by millions of pilgrims over the centuries. Can you imagine the weight of history that these doors have witnessed? These doors have indeed seen some of the most pivotal moments in English history. Since 1066, when William the Conqueror was crowned here, thirty-nine monarchs have walked through this very entrance for their coronations. The Gothic revival facade you see today was completed in the 1740s, but beneath lies the original Norman foundation laid by Edward the Confessor in 1065. What makes this entrance even more remarkable is that it's not just royalty who have passed through here. One of the most touching stories involves Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. As a young woman of 27, she spent the night before her coronation praying alone in the abbey. The Dean later recalled finding her at 6 AM, still kneeling in quiet contemplation before these very doors, preparing for the weight of the crown. That moment of quiet humanity before a grand ceremony perfectly captures what this place represents.",

### 4. **Rich and Original Content**
- Strict adherence to minimum content requirements (see standards above)

- Fascinating storytelling instead of mundane explanations
- Historical facts + human emotions + on-site immersion

### 5. **Dynamic Chapter Configuration**

- **Small locations: 3-4, Medium: 5-6, Large complexes: 7-8**
- **🔴 CRITICAL: Perfect match between route.steps and realTimeGuide.chapters count and titles**

## 💡 Audio Guide Writing Examples

**❌ Poor Example (Disconnected, template-style)**:
- sceneDescription: "Westminster Abbey is a Gothic church. It is 20 meters high."
- coreNarrative: "It was built in 1245. Many kings were crowned here."
- humanStories: "Shakespeare is buried here. There were restoration works."

**✅ Improved Natural Example**:
- sceneDescription: "Westminster Abbey stands as a testament to nearly a millennium of English history, its Gothic spires reaching toward heaven while its foundations anchor us to the past. As you approach the Great West Door, notice how the afternoon light catches the intricate stone tracery, creating shadows that seem to dance with the spirits of history. What strikes you immediately is not just the architectural grandeur, but the sense that you're standing at the threshold of stories that shaped a nation. Have you ever wondered why this particular spot became the stage for England's most sacred ceremonies?"
- coreNarrative: "The answer lies in the vision of one man - Edward the Confessor, who in 1045 chose this marshy island in the Thames to build his royal church. His decision wasn't just practical; it was prophetic. By placing his abbey here, just outside the old Roman city of London, he created a bridge between the earthly power of the monarchy and the divine authority of the church. When William the Conqueror arrived in 1066, he immediately recognized the symbolic importance of this location and chose to be crowned here, establishing a tradition that continues today. But the real magic of this place isn't just in its royal connections..."
- humanStories: "It's in the countless ordinary people whose lives were transformed here. Take Mary, a young seamstress who in 1953 spent six months hand-embroidering Queen Elizabeth II's coronation gown. Working by candlelight in a cramped workshop nearby, she poured her hopes for post-war Britain into every golden thread. Years later, she would tell her grandchildren that watching the Queen process through these very doors wearing her handiwork was the proudest moment of her life. Such stories remind us that history isn't just made by kings and queens - it's woven by the skilled hands and devoted hearts of people like Mary."
