The intricate stone carvings above tell stories of saints and sinners, while the worn steps beneath your feet have been polished smooth by millions of pilgrims over the centuries. Can you imagine the weight of history that these doors have witnessed? These doors have indeed seen some of the most pivotal moments in English history. Since 1066, when William the Conqueror was crowned here, thirty-nine monarchs have walked through this very entrance for their coronations. The Gothic revival facade you see today was completed in the 1740s, but beneath lies the original Norman foundation laid by Edward the Confessor in 1065. What makes this entrance even more remarkable is that it's not just royalty who have passed through here. One of the most touching stories involves Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. As a young woman of 27, she spent the night before her coronation praying alone in the abbey. The Dean later recalled finding her at 6 AM, still kneeling in quiet contemplation before these very doors, preparing for the weight of the crown. That moment of quiet humanity before a grand ceremony perfectly captures what this place represents.",

## üéØ Location-Specific Expert Requirements

### üìç **${locationType.toUpperCase()} Professional Standards**
${getLocationSpecificRequirements(locationType)}

${userContext}

## üìã Output Format Requirements

### 1. **Pure JSON Only**
- Return ONLY valid JSON without any introduction, explanation, or code blocks
- Perfect JSON syntax compliance (commas, quotes, brackets)
- Key names must be 100% identical to examples

### üöÄ **Quality Enhancement Core Principles**
- **Expertise**: ${typeConfig?.expertRole || 'Comprehensive expert'} level depth and insight
- **Accuracy**: Only verifiable, specific facts and measurements
- **Uniqueness**: Distinctive features that set this location apart
- **Storytelling**: Compelling narratives, not dry information

### üîç **${locationType.toUpperCase()} Quality Validation Criteria**
${getQualityRequirementsByType(locationType)}

### üö® **Strictly Prohibited**
- **Generic phrases**: "Imagine", "wonderful", "amazing", "you will experience"
- **Vague references**: "here", "this place" (must use specific location names)
- **Unverifiable content**: Speculation, assumptions, personal opinions
- **Empty content**: Information that merely fills space without substance
- **üî• Repetitive information**: Same historical background, construction/restoration dates across multiple chapters

${audioStyle.format}

### 4. **Rich and Original Content**
- Strict adherence to minimum content requirements (see standards above)
- Original descriptions that capture the location's unique character
- Fascinating storytelling instead of mundane explanations
- Historical facts + human emotions + on-site immersion

### üö® **Anti-Repetition Guidelines (Critical!)**
**For complex sites (palaces, temples, campuses, parks) strictly avoid repetition:**

#### ‚úÖ **Correct Information Distribution**
- **Chapter 1**: Overall historical background (founding, restoration, major events)
- **Chapters 2+**: Each building's unique features, functions, and special stories

#### ‚ùå **Forbidden Repetition Patterns**
Wrong Example:
‚Ä¢ Chapter 1: "Changgyeonggung Palace was built in 1484 and destroyed during Japanese invasions in 1592, then restored in 1604"
‚Ä¢ Chapter 2: "Honghwamun Gate was built in 1484 with Changgyeonggung..." ‚Üê üö´ Repetitive!
‚Ä¢ Chapter 3: "Myeongjeongjeon Hall was also built in 1484..." ‚Üê üö´ Repetitive!

#### ‚úÖ **Correct Example**
‚Ä¢ Chapter 1: "Changgyeonggung Palace: founded 1484, destroyed 1592, restored 1604"
‚Ä¢ Chapter 2: "Honghwamun Gate's unique architectural style and decorative meanings" ‚Üê ‚úÖ Unique!
‚Ä¢ Chapter 3: "Myeongjeongjeon Hall's throne and ceiling patterns, political functions" ‚Üê ‚úÖ Specific!

#### **üéØ Chapter Differentiation Strategies**
- **Architectural features**: Roof types, pillar styles, decorative elements
- **Functional roles**: Purpose, ceremonies, actual usage methods
- **Unique stories**: Special events that happened only in that building
- **Artistic values**: Special paintings, sculptures, plaque meanings
- **Viewing points**: Must-see details, optimal viewing angles

### 5. **Dynamic Chapter Configuration**
- **Generate appropriate number of chapters based on location scale and characteristics**
- **Small locations: 3-4, Medium: 5-6, Large complexes: 7-8**
- **üî¥ CRITICAL: Perfect match between route.steps and realTimeGuide.chapters count and titles**

## üí° Audio Guide Writing Examples

**‚ùå Poor Example (Disconnected, template-style)**:
- sceneDescription: "Westminster Abbey is a Gothic church. It is 20 meters high."
- coreNarrative: "It was built in 1245. Many kings were crowned here."
- humanStories: "Shakespeare is buried here. There were restoration works."

**‚úÖ Improved Natural Example**:
- sceneDescription: "Westminster Abbey stands as a testament to nearly a millennium of English history, its Gothic spires reaching toward heaven while its foundations anchor us to the past. As you approach the Great West Door, notice how the afternoon light catches the intricate stone tracery, creating shadows that seem to dance with the spirits of history. What strikes you immediately is not just the architectural grandeur, but the sense that you're standing at the threshold of stories that shaped a nation. Have you ever wondered why this particular spot became the stage for England's most sacred ceremonies?"
- coreNarrative: "The answer lies in the vision of one man - Edward the Confessor, who in 1045 chose this marshy island in the Thames to build his royal church. His decision wasn't just practical; it was prophetic. By placing his abbey here, just outside the old Roman city of London, he created a bridge between the earthly power of the monarchy and the divine authority of the church. When William the Conqueror arrived in 1066, he immediately recognized the symbolic importance of this location and chose to be crowned here, establishing a tradition that continues today. But the real magic of this place isn't just in its royal connections..."
- humanStories: "It's in the countless ordinary people whose lives were transformed here. Take Mary, a young seamstress who in 1953 spent six months hand-embroidering Queen Elizabeth II's coronation gown. Working by candlelight in a cramped workshop nearby, she poured her hopes for post-war Britain into every golden thread. Years later, she would tell her grandchildren that watching the Queen process through these very doors wearing her handiwork was the proudest moment of her life. Such stories remind us that history isn't just made by kings and queens - it's woven by the skilled hands and devoted hearts of people like Mary."

1. **On-site Description** (400-500 chars): Vivid scene visitors can actually see and feel
2. **Historical Background** (600-700 chars): History, architectural features, cultural significance of this place
3. **Character Stories** (300-400 chars): Actual historical figures or verified anecdotes
4. **Next Movement Guidance** (100-200 chars): Specific route and next location preview

üé≠ Style Guide
- Friendly conversational tone ("What's notable here is", "An interesting fact is", "If you listen to the story" etc.)
- Educational yet entertaining storytelling
- Friendliness as if a friend is explaining beside you
- **Each part naturally continues as one complete story**

üö´ **Absolutely Prohibited**
- Never use greetings like "Hello", "Everyone!", "Yes, everyone!" (from chapter 1)
- Prohibited incomplete expressions like "...will be covered in more detail later...", "...more detailed content shortly..."
- Prohibited writing briefly - **must have 1400-1500 characters of rich content**

‚úÖ **Recommended Starting Expressions**
- "At this location..." "What's notable here is..." "Interestingly..."
- "Right in front of you..." "At this place..."
- "Now we are..." "Continuing on..." "Next we'll encounter..."

‚úÖ Required Output Format
